Git: 

* The verison control software (the application/codes)


Github:

* A website, which allows you to do git.



Repo: 

* The project or a place in which many files can exist.


Commit: 

* A button which allows you to save your current verison of your work. Whenever you press the commit button, the current verison will be saved. What this means is that if you pressed the commit button three times (three new verison of your work), you will have three verisons, in your history, which you can revisit later on. 
* The **commit hash** is a number that is unqiue to that specific verison. 
    Here is an comparison: Each student has their own unqiue OSIS number. NO students have the same numbers.
